/**
 * Fractional / lexicographic rank keys for ordering cards within a lane.
 *
 * A key is a short string that sorts lexicographically. Inserting between two
 * cards mints a new key strictly between their keys, so only the moved card is
 * rewritten — no neighbour churn, no array-rewrite conflicts. See
 * `project-assets/GitKittie/GitKanban/plan/sync-model.md`.
 *
 * Thin, well-tested wrappers over `fractional-indexing` so call sites read in
 * board terms rather than library terms. The Swift port mirrors these.
